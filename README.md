# Assignment 4 — Responsive Web Design

This project demonstrates **Media Queries** and **Bootstrap 5 Grid** for a responsive portfolio.

## What’s included
- **Task 0 (Typography):** Font sizes adapt for mobile, tablet, desktop via CSS media queries.
- **Task 1 (Boxes layout):** Three boxes layout: stacked on mobile, two-per-row on tablet, three-per-row on desktop — pure CSS (no Bootstrap).
- **Task 2 (Bootstrap columns):** `col-md-6 col-lg-4` to achieve 2 columns on tablet and 3 on desktop.
- **Task 3 (Navbar):** Responsive bootstrap navbar with hamburger on small screens.
- **Task 4 (Portfolio page):** Left: cards grid; Right: sidebar. Extra media-query polish in `style.css`.
